## What is it? 

  

Imagine if you could switch your pedals in any order, save that order as presets, assign it to a foot switch, and effortlessly and quickly rock n roll. Traditionally pedals are arranged in a sequential order.  However, what if you wanted to rearrange that sequential order to achieve a certain sound. For instance, reverb then distortion sounds very different from distortion then reverb. On most pedal boards this is not something that can be quickly configured.  Even with pedal switching boards you are often limited to just adding in the pedals in an fx loop via a button press.  what if you wanted to use two delay pedals in parallel so that the delay from the first pedal does not affect the delay of the other.  Perhaps you'd like to be able to turn on and off 3 fx simultaneously via one foot switch for a crucial moment in a song.  

  

This is the job of a pedal switcher, but the Heighliner offers a few more features worth noting.  

  

1.) The slim profile(approx. 16" by 4") means that it takes up significantly less real estate than other pedal switchers.   

  

2.) The UI is quick, responsive, and intuitive.   

  

3.) It is entirely stereo but supports mono as well.   

  

4.) Input volume, left and right output volume, and the phase of each channel (both left and right) are savable in the presets, requiring even less knob turning.   

  

  

## How to run 

  

The Heighliner core is an Arduino Mega 2560 Pro (Mega) and thus requires the Arduino framework. This project, however, uses the platformIo platform to compile, upload, and communicate with the Mega. PlatformIO
